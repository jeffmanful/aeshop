Notes:

I opted for Typescript for the compile time type safety. 
For runtime typeschecking I would opt to use: babel-plugin-typescript-to-proptypes to convert the type declarations for components to proptypes. https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-typescript-to-proptypes

Unfortunately I ran out of time and spent a lot of time fiddling with ejecting from create-react app.

Clicking on a product navigates to a page for that product. It would be more fleshed out if I had more time.
